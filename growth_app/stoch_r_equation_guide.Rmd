##### __Equation Guide__

* $N$ is the population at a given time-step (t)  
* $r_d$ is the mean descrete growth factor for a normal distribution from which $r$ is drawn. 
    * $r=0$ is no growth
    * $r>0$ is positive growth 
    * $r<0$ is negative growth
* $K$ is the carrying capacity
* $r$ SD is the standard deviation of the normal distribution for which $r_d$ is the mean


In this example stochasticity is simply included by drawing the value of $r$ from a gaussian distribution per time-step.
