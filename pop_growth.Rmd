#Part 1: Let's start with exponential population growth
Density independent growth
$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN$$

---
#Exponential growth
What is required for a population to grow?

--

How many births and how many deaths?


$$N_{t+1} = N_t + B - D + I - E$$


- $B$ =  _Births_

- $D$ =  _Deaths_

- $I$ =  _Immigration_

- $E$ =  _Emigration_

--


If we assume that immigration and emmigration are equal, then the change in population size is:

$$\Delta N = B - D$$
---
#Exponential growth

$$\Delta N = B - D$$

#Exponential growth

_Change in population_ ( $dN$ ) _over a very small interval of time_ ( $dt$ ) can be described as: 

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=B-D$$

--

- Births and deaths are also described in rates:

.pull-left[
$$B = bN$$
$b$ = instantaneous birth rate

[births / (individual * time)]
]

.pull-right[
$$D = dN$$


$d$ = instantaneous death rate

[deaths / (individual * time)]

]
---
#Exponential growth
_SO_ change in population over time can be described as

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=(b-d)N$$

--

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=(0.55-0.50)N$$

--

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=(0.55-0.50)*100$$
--

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=0.05*100$$
--

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=5$$

---
#Exponential growth

If we let $b-d$ become the constant $r$, the __intrinsic rate of increase__, we have the continuous exponential growth equation:

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN$$
--

.center[
<img src="pop_growth_files/ta_da.png" style="width: 60%" />
]

---
#Exponential growth

Change in population is equal to the intrinsic rate of increase ( $r$ ) multiplied by the population size ( $N$ )

.pull-left[
$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN$$
]

.pull-right[
$N$ = _population size_

$r$ = _intrinsic rate or increase_
]


$r$ defines how fast a population is growing or declining
- $r=0$ no growth
- $r>0$ positive growth 
- $r<0$ negative growth

The differential equation tells us growth __rate__ not population size

---
#Exponential growth
The population of an exponentially growing population at a given time $t$ can be worked out by:

$$N_t = N_0e^{rt}$$
Look familiar from assignment 1?

--

The discrete version of the exponential equation tells us the number added to the population per time-step:

$$N_{t+1} = N_t + r_dN_t$$

$$N_{t+1} = 100 + 0.05 * 100$$
$$N_{t+1} = 105$$
$N_t$ = Population size at time t

$r_d$ = discrete growth factor

---
#Exponential growth

.pull-left[

Theoretical populations of populations growing (and declining) as a result of different values of $r$

- $r=0$ no growth
- $r>0$ positive growth 
- $r<0$ negative growth

Because growth rate is exponential, by taking the natural logarithm of the population size the graphed lines become straight

# Exponential growth

- Populations growing exponentially have a doubling time

- The doubling time depends on the growth rate $r$ and is _not_ every year

- Surely no species can grow forever exponentially?!?!?!
 - _Correct!_ Welcome to part 2, __density dependence__

---
class: inverse, middle, center

#Take 5 minutes to discuss the assumptions of the exponential growth model

---
class: inverse, middle, center

#Part 2: Logistic population growth
Density dependent growth
$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\left(1- \frac{N}{K} \right)$$
---
#Logistic growth
Now we will look at populations which do not grow forever but reach a __carrying capacity__ ( $K$ )

$K$ represents the maximum population size that can be supported considering limiting factors such as food, shelter and space

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\left(1- \frac{N}{K} \right)$$
$N$ = Population size

$r$ = Intrinsic rate of increase

$K$ = Carrying capacity

---
#Logistic growth
Consider the term $\left(1- \frac{N}{K} \right)$ as a penalty on the growth of the population depending on the number of individuals in the community

- Very crowded communities have a high penalty compared to ones with plenty of space and resources

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\left(1- \frac{N}{K} \right)$$


--
- At the point the population reaches the carrying capacity: $N$ will = $K$, and the fraction $\frac{N}{K}$ will = 1

- The term $\left(1- \frac{N}{K} \right)$ will collapse to 0 and the change in population will = 0. The equation will be multiplied by 0 and equal 0

- So the population will remain at size $K$

---

#Logistic growth
If the population is very small, $N$ is small relative to $K$, then the penalty is small

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\left(1- \frac{N}{K} \right)$$
--

However, as we learned from exponential growth, a population grows in proportion to its size.

  - A population of 1000 seabirds will produce more eggs than a population of 100.
  - In the logistic growth equation the proportion added to the population decreases as the population grows reaching 0 when $N = K$
  


---
#Logistic growth
$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\left(1- \frac{N}{K} \right)$$
- If $K = 100$ and $N = 7$ then the unused space is $1-(7/100) = 0.93$ and the population is growing at 93% of the growth rate of an exponentially growing population

- If $K = 100$ and $N = 98$ then the unused proportion of capacity is $1-(98/100) = 0.02$ and growth is at 2% of the growth rate of an exponentially growing population

--

The point at which a population is the largest relative to the penalty for its size is at $K/2$

- What this means is the growth rate of a population is fastest at half its carrying capacity
  
- As it grows bigger than $K/2$ the penalty becomes stronger but below $K/2$ the population is small and the proportion added to the population is small

---

#Logistic growth
Now we will look at the discrete form of the equation:

$$N_{t+1} = N_t + r_dN_t\left(1- \frac{N_t}{K} \right)$$
$N_t$ = Population size at time t

$r_d$ = discrete growth factor

$K$ = Carrying capacity

--

- Instead of telling us the change in a population at an infinitely small point in time, the discrete equation tells us the size of the population at a given time.

---
#Logistic growth

The size of the population at the next time-step is equal to:

- The size of the current population plus the current population multiplied by the discrete growth rate and the density penalty.

$$N_{t+1} = N_t + r_dN_t\left(1- \frac{N_t}{K} \right)$$
--

$$N_{t+1} = 100 + 0.05 * 100 \left(1- \frac{100}{200} \right)$$
--

$$N_{t+1} = 102.5$$
--
Remember how in the exponential model $N_{t+1} = 105$ ?

#Stochasticity

Until now, everything we have looked at has been _entirely_ deterministic but is this true of the real world?

$$N_{t+1} = N_t + r_dN_t\left(1- \frac{N_t}{K} \right)$$

Environmental stochasticity
- Populations go through good and bad times and are not constant
- We can represent this by adding variance to the growth rate $r_d$
]

Demographic stochasticity
- By chance a population might have a run of births or a run of deaths
- Demographic stochasticity includes the probability of births and deaths in the parmeter $r$
]

- Variability can also be included in $K$, the carrying capacity!


We will focus on _environmental stochasticity_

#Recap

We have looked at:
- discrete and continuous equations for __exponential growth__
  - also known as __density independent__ growth
  
- discrete and continuous equations for __logistic growth__
  - also known as __density dependent__ growth
  
- __Stochastic__ logistic growth

- We have discussed model __assumptions__

---
#Key points
- __Exponentially__ growing populations grow proportional to their size indefinitely

- __Logistically__ growing populations experience a penalty that increases with population size
  - Growth rate is greatest at half the carrying capacity when the population size is at its largest relative to the density penalty
  
- __Stochasticity__ can have a serious effect on populations and deterministic models do not account for stochasticity

- __Assumptions are key__, _think about these for the assignment_
  

---

#Things to be aware of
- Differences in continuous and discrete equation
  - Different notation and descriptions of $r$
  - Mathematical differences 

- Many diferent population growth equations
  - We have not talked about the model $N_{t+1} = \lambda N_t\left(1- \frac{N_t}{K} \right)$. I recommend reading about it
  - Concepts can be transferable but be aware while reading results may not be the same
  
- This is just the beginning
  - Population growth models get _much much_ more complicated to deal with more complicated species, for example, age structured population and competition
