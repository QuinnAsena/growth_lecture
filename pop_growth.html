# Part 1: Why be interested in population growth?

--
- Project future populations

  - Human population expected to be 9.8 billion by 2050

--

- Conservation of species

--

- Sustainable use of resources

--

- Many more

#Part 1: Let's start with exponential population growth
Density independent growth
`$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN$$`

---
#Exponential growth
What is required for a population to grow?

--

How many births and how many deaths?


`$$N_{t+1} = N_t + B - D + I - E$$`


- `\(B\)` =  _Births_

- `\(D\)` =  _Deaths_

- `\(I\)` =  _Immigration_

- `\(E\)` =  _Emigration_

--


If we assume that immigration and emigration are equal, then the change in population size is:

`$$\Delta N = B - D$$`
---
#Exponential growth

`$$\Delta N = B - D$$`
.pull-left[
- More births than deaths the population grows

#Exponential growth

_Change in population_ ( `\(dN\)` ) _over a very small interval of time_ ( `\(dt\)` ) can be described as: 

`$$\frac{dN}{dt}=B-D$$`

--

- Births and deaths are also described in rates:

.pull-left[
`$$B = bN$$`
`\(b\)` = instantaneous birth rate

[births / (individual * time)]
]

.pull-right[
`$$D = dN$$`


`\(d\)` = instantaneous death rate

[deaths / (individual * time)]

]
---
#Exponential growth
_SO_ change in population over time can be described as

`$$\frac{dN}{dt}=(b-d)N$$`

--

`$$\frac{dN}{dt}=(0.55-0.50)N$$`

--

`$$\frac{dN}{dt}=(0.55-0.50)*100$$`
--

`$$\frac{dN}{dt}=0.05*100$$`
--

`$$\frac{dN}{dt}=5$$`

---
#Exponential growth

If we let `\(b-d\)` become the constant `\(r\)`, the __intrinsic rate of increase__, we have the continuous exponential growth equation:

`$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN$$`
--

&lt;img src="pop_growth_files/ta_da.png" style="width: 60%" /&gt;

#Exponential growth

Change in population is equal to the intrinsic rate of increase ( `\(r\)` ) multiplied by the population size ( `\(N\)` )

.pull-left[
`$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN$$`
]

.pull-right[
`\(N\)` = _population size_

`\(r\)` = _intrinsic rate or increase_
]


`\(r\)` defines how fast a population is growing or declining
- `\(r=0\)` no growth
- `\(r&gt;0\)` positive growth 
- `\(r&lt;0\)` negative growth

The differential equation tells us growth __rate__ not population size

---
#Exponential growth
The population of an exponentially growing population at a given time `\(t\)` can be worked out by:

`$$N_t = N_0e^{rt}$$`
Look familiar from assignment 1?

--

The discrete version of the exponential equation tells us the number added to the population per time-step:

`$$N_{t+1} = N_t + r_dN_t$$`

`$$N_{t+1} = 100 + 0.05 * 100$$`
`$$N_{t+1} = 105$$`
`\(N_t\)` = Population size at time t

`\(r_d\)` = discrete growth factor

---
#Exponential growth

.pull-left[

Theoretical populations growing and declining as a result of different values of `\(r\)`

- `\(r=0\)` no growth
- `\(r&gt;0\)` positive growth 
- `\(r&lt;0\)` negative growth

Because growth rate is exponential, by taking the natural logarithm of the population size the graphed lines become straight

#Growth rates
Population increases exponentially but __Growth rate__ over __population size__ increases proportionally with the population

# Exponential growth

- Populations growing exponentially have a doubling time

- The doubling time depends on the growth rate `\(r\)` and is _not_ every year

- ﴾͡๏̯͡๏﴿  Surely no species can grow forever exponentially?!?!?!
 - _Correct!_ Welcome to part 2, __density dependence__

---

#Take 5 minutes to discuss the assumptions of the exponential growth model

class: inverse, middle, center

#Part 2: Logistic population growth
Density dependent growth
`$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\left(1- \frac{N}{K} \right)$$`
---
#Logistic growth
Now we will look at populations which do not grow forever but reach a __carrying capacity__ ( `\(K\)` )

`\(K\)` represents the maximum population size that can be supported considering limiting factors such as food, shelter and space

`$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\left(1- \frac{N}{K} \right)$$`
`\(N\)` = Population size

`\(r\)` = Intrinsic rate of increase

`\(K\)` = Carrying capacity

---
#Logistic growth
Consider the term `\(\left(1- \frac{N}{K} \right)\)` as a penalty on the growth of the population depending on the number of individuals in the community

- Very crowded communities have a high penalty compared to ones with plenty of space and resources

`$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\left(1- \frac{N}{K} \right)$$`


--
- At the point the population reaches the carrying capacity: `\(N\)` will = `\(K\)`, and the fraction `\(\frac{N}{K}\)` will = 1

- The term `\(\left(1- \frac{N}{K} \right)\)` will collapse to 0 and the change in population will = 0. The equation will be multiplied by 0 and equal 0

- So the population will remain at size `\(K\)`

---

#Logistic growth
If the population is very small, `\(N\)` is small relative to `\(K\)`, then the penalty is small

`$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\left(1- \frac{N}{K} \right)$$`
--

However, as we learned from exponential growth, a population grows in proportion to its size.

  - A population of 1000 seabirds will produce more eggs than a population of 100.
  - In the logistic growth equation the proportion added to the population decreases as the population grows reaching 0 when `\(N = K\)`
  


---
#Logistic growth
`$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\left(1- \frac{N}{K} \right)$$`
- If `\(K = 100\)` and `\(N = 7\)` then the unused space is `\(1-(7/100) = 0.93\)` and the population is growing at 93% of the growth rate of an exponentially growing population

- If `\(K = 100\)` and `\(N = 98\)` then the unused proportion of capacity is `\(1-(98/100) = 0.02\)` and growth is at 2% of the growth rate of an exponentially growing population

--

The point at which a population is the largest relative to the penalty for its size is at `\(K/2\)`

- What this means is the growth rate of a population is fastest at half its carrying capacity
  
- As it grows bigger than `\(K/2\)` the penalty becomes stronger but below `\(K/2\)` the population is small and the proportion added to the population is small

---
#Logistic growth

_Thanos should have studied population ecology_

.pull-left[

- If a species is at capacity, its growth rate will increase to maximum if you cut it in half.

- Not all species are equal so cutting all in half will not have an equal effect...

#Logistic growth
Now we will look at the discrete form of the equation:

`$$N_{t+1} = N_t + r_dN_t\left(1- \frac{N_t}{K} \right)$$`
`\(N_t\)` = Population size at time t

`\(r_d\)` = discrete growth factor

`\(K\)` = Carrying capacity

--

- Instead of telling us the change in a population at an infinitely small point in time, the discrete equation tells us the size of the population at a given time.

---
#Logistic growth

The size of the population at the next time-step is equal to:

- The size of the current population plus the current population multiplied by the discrete growth rate and the density penalty.

`$$N_{t+1} = N_t + r_dN_t\left(1- \frac{N_t}{K} \right)$$`
--

`$$N_{t+1} = 100 + 0.05 * 100 \left(1- \frac{100}{200} \right)$$`
--

`$$N_{t+1} = 102.5$$`
--
Remember how in the exponential model `\(N_{t+1} = 105\)` ?

---
#Logistic growth

__Unlike__ the exponential model, the logistic model growth rate is dependent on population size and reaches its peak at half of the carrying capacity

#Part 3: Introducing stochasticity
Non-deterministic growth

---
#Stochasticity

Until now, everything we have looked at has been _entirely_ deterministic but is this true of the real world?

`$$N_{t+1} = N_t + r_dN_t\left(1- \frac{N_t}{K} \right)$$`

.pull-left[
Environmental stochasticity
- Populations go through good and bad times and are not constant
- We can represent this by adding variance to the growth rate `\(r_d\)`
]

.pull-right[
Demographic stochasticity
- By chance a population might have a run of births or a run of deaths
- Demographic stochasticity includes the probability of births and deaths in the parameter `\(r\)`
]

--

- Variability can also be included in `\(K\)`, the carrying capacity!


We will focus on _environmental stochasticity_
---
#Stochasticity
Even if __average__ growth rate is positive some stochasticity can drive extinction

#Recap

We have looked at:
- discrete and continuous equations for __exponential growth__
  - also known as __density independent__ growth
  
- discrete and continuous equations for __logistic growth__
  - also known as __density dependent__ growth
  
- __Stochastic__ logistic growth

- We have discussed model __assumptions__

---
#Key points
- __Exponentially__ growing populations grow proportional to their size indefinitely

- __Logistically__ growing populations experience a penalty that increases with population size
  - Growth rate is greatest at half the carrying capacity when the population size is at its largest relative to the density penalty
  
- __Stochasticity__ can have a serious effect on populations and deterministic models do not account for stochasticity

- __Assumptions are key__, _think about these for the assignment_
  

---

#Things to be aware of
- Differences in continuous and discrete equation
  - Different notation and descriptions of `\(r\)`
  - Mathematical differences 

- Many different population growth equations
  - We have not talked about the model `\(N_{t+1} = \lambda N_t\left(1- \frac{N_t}{K} \right)\)`.
  
  - Concepts can be transferable but be aware while reading results may not be the same
  
- This is just the beginning
  - Population growth models get _much much_ more complicated to deal with more complicated species, for example, age structured population and competition

---

# Top tips for the assignment

- Attend labs and office hours

- Understand the two key graphs: population vs time and growth-rate vs population

- Use the app to understand different parameters (but do not use screenshots from the app for your assignment)

- Rubbish in rubbish out. If model outputs look crazy or the numbers don't make logical sense then double check your inputs and equations.
